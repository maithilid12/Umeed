Suicide Prevention Application with Chatbot functionality
This is Suicide Prevention Chatbot

Every life is precious and worth the fight. The aim is give back to the society by building this android based chatbot which chats with the victim to calm his or her mood. Looking at the severity of conditions either detected by chatbot or inbuilt quizzes, counsellors or psychologists are suggested. The quiz helps determine the anxiety and depression score and the graphs will give a pictorial representation of the victim’s improvement. Victim can also read alternatives to suicide. The light and happy UI is aimed at soothing the user with visual cues.
The app is divided into two main sections: chatbot and login activities. Login Activities include basic login and a total of 4 options including taking a quiz, viewing counsellors near me (victim) using integrated  maps, alternatives for suicide and a graph which gives an analysis report of the anxiety and depression levels (showing improvement in health). This app starts with a basic splash screen animation. Splash Screen leads to an activity giving the victim to a choice to chat with our chatbot Eliza or login and view the other 4 options. According to the user’s vulnerability he/she can decide whether to directly chat with the bot or login, give quiz and go on accordingly.
Feedback form is also provided which will help improve the app constantly so that the software doesn’t deteriorate and keeps meeting the current scenario demands.
